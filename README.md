## PROCESS REVIEWS

 At Makers, reviews are the most effective way to see if your processes are of a professional standard. They are conducted by [CoGrammar](https://www.cogrammar.com/)

This repository is a record of my reviews during my time at Makers.

 ### What happens during a Review at Makers?
 The Review is an hour-long remote session conducted via Zoom. The reviewer roleplays as a product owner with a set of non-technical requirements. The developer uses the Makers dev process to convert these requirements into a working, tested, well-written application.

The Review assesses how well a developer:

- Converts fuzzy, human wants and needs into technical requirements,
- Writes good tests,
- Writes clean code,
- Debugs when things go wrong,
- Delivers value to the customer in an Agile way.

The review offers developers formative feedback: feedback to help Makers do better, and prepare them for job interviews and developer roles. Itâ€™s not summative - there is no pass/fail measurement involved.

## GENERAL FEEDBACK

**18 January 2021 / 01:00 PM / Reviewer: Joshua van Staden** 
"Well done on completing your third code review. Your information-gathering was well-handled, and the only detail missed out on was the way that the system handles capital letters in words. It is good that you clarified this during the session, however. Your modelling has some room for improvement, the details of which are outlined in the modelling section of this review. Your test progression was mostly perfect, except for the fifth test case that was redundant, as well as the fact that a finer detail was implemented before finishing the core functionality. It is very good that you found a point to refactor: however, there is still some work to be done in your refactoring. Otherwise, I am overall very happy with your development process and look forward to seeing you in future reviews!"

"You have improved dramatically! Your investment in improving your development process is showing off quite well! I was impressed with the session and think you now have a stable process. For your further improvement, I encourage you to work on refactoring as part of your development iterations. Other than, keep it up!"

"You had a good reflection on your process and where you could improve. If you practise using your method through the reviews and your projects, you might find it less intimidating. I believe you have the right idea for what your process should look like and need time to become comfortable as a developer. I wish you the best of luck!"
