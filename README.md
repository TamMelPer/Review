## PROCESS REVIEWS

 At Makers, reviews are the most effective way to see if your processes are of a professional standard. They’re an hour long, giving you a great read on how you’re working.

This repository is a record of my reviews during my time at Makers.

 ### What happens during a Review at Makers?
 The Review is an hour-long remote session conducted via Zoom. The reviewer roleplays as a product owner with a set of non-technical requirements. The developer uses the Makers dev process to convert these requirements into a working, tested, well-written application.

The Review assesses how well a developer:

- Converts fuzzy, human wants and needs into technical requirements,
- Writes good tests,
- Writes clean code,
- Debugs when things go wrong,
- Delivers value to the customer in an Agile way.

The review offers developers formative feedback: feedback to help Makers do better, and prepare them for job interviews and developer roles. It’s not summative - there is no pass/fail measurement involved.

"You have improved dramatically! Your investment in improving your development process is showing off quite well! I was impressed with the session and think you now have a stable process. For your further improvement, I encourage you to work on refactoring as part of your development iterations. Other than, keep it up!"

"You had a good reflection on your process and where you could improve. If you practise using your method through the reviews and your projects, you might find it less intimidating. I believe you have the right idea for what your process should look like and need time to become comfortable as a developer. I wish you the best of luck!"
