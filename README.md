## PROCESS REVIEWS

 At Makers, reviews are the most effective way to see if your processes are of a professional standard. They’re an hour long, giving you a great read on how you’re working.

This repository is a record of my reviews during my time at Makers.

 ### What happens during a Review at Makers?
 The Review is an hour-long remote session conducted via Zoom. The reviewer roleplays as a product owner with a set of non-technical requirements. The developer uses the Makers dev process to convert these requirements into a working, tested, well-written application.

The Review assesses how well a developer:

 - Converts fuzzy, human wants and needs into technical requirements,
- Writes good tests,
- Writes clean code,
- Debugs when things go wrong,
- Delivers value to the customer in an Agile way.

The review offers developers formative feedback: feedback to help Makers do better, and prepare them for job interviews and developer roles. It’s not summative - there is no pass/fail measurement involved.
